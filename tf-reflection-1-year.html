        <p class="text_computer">
          In June 2025, I completed my first year on the <a id="link" href="https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/">Teach First</a> training programme and was awarded QTS. Reaching this point felt like a huge milestone, but also just the beginning of what I hope will be a long teaching journey. Moving from trainee to qualified teacher has brought a change in mindset as well as title. I now feel a greater sense of responsibility, not only for delivering lessons but for shaping the wider experience of my pupils.
          <br> <br>
          When I think back to September, I remember the nerves of walking into a new school, meeting new colleagues, and facing a timetable full of lessons that I had only really practiced on paper or across Zoom calls during Teach First's Summer Institute. The year that followed was full of challenges, steep learning curves, and moments of real pride.
          <br> <br>
          Now, as I begin my second year at the same school, there is a different energy. I feel more rooted, more confident, and more prepared to take on greater responsibility. The past twelve months have not only shaped my practice in the classroom but also taught me a huge amount about resilience, reflection, and growth.
        </p>
          <h2>Growing Confidence</h2>
          <p class="text_computer">
          The biggest change I have noticed in myself since September is my confidence in the classroom. At the start of the year, I was often focused on following the plan exactly as it was written. I sometimes took time to consider what needed to be done or be changed, lacking that teacher instinct that comes from experience. I worried about how it might impact the rest of the lesson, and pupil progress.
            <br> <br>
          Over time, though, I learned to manage situations as they arose and to think more clearly in the moment. This shift has been transformative. Rather than feeling thrown off when pupils asked a difficult question, when technology failed, or when behaviour needed addressing, I found I could adapt and carry on without losing momentum. I feel much more able to balance the flow of a lesson with the realities of the classroom, and that confidence has been one of the most rewarding parts of my journey so far.
          </p>
          <h2>Managing Behaviour</h2>
          <p class="text_computer">
          Behaviour management was, without question, the biggest challenge of my first year. Coming from a university teaching background, I had not encountered the same kinds of issues with behaviour that arise in a secondary school classroom. It was a steep learning curve to shift from guiding motivated undergraduates to setting clear expectations with pupils, responding consistently, and building routines that supported learning.
            <br> <br>
          At times, it was difficult not to take behaviour personally, especially when lessons didn’t go as planned. What helped me most was leaning on the support of colleagues and mentors, as well as reflecting carefully after each lesson. I began to see how consistency and calm responses could transform lessons. By the end of the year, I felt more confident in creating a positive classroom environment where learning could take place. This is the classroom environment that I have endeavoured to start with this September.
          </p>
          <h2>Highlights of the Year</h2>
          <p class="text_computer">
          Alongside the challenges, there were many moments in my first year that reminded me why I wanted to teach. One of the most rewarding parts was seeing the progress of my classes from September to July. Watching pupils grow in confidence, develop their skills, and achieve success in areas they had once found difficult gave me a real sense of purpose.
            <br> <br>
          One pupil told me that Computing had gone from being their least favourite subject to one they were now considering for GCSE. Hearing that shift in attitude was a reminder of the difference that day-to-day teaching can make. I also received thank you cards from pupils at the end of the year, with some even referring to me as their favourite teacher. Those moments of appreciation meant a great deal and reminded me of the positive impact teachers can have beyond the classroom content.
            <br> <br>
          One of my favourite topics to teach last year was binary and logic gates. What could have been a very abstract concept became much more engaging through an effective <a id="link" href="https://tommysthoughts.thetommyverse.com/unplugged-activities.html">unplugged activity</a>. By getting pupils to physically represent inputs, outputs, and connections, they were able to “act out” how the gates worked before moving on to diagrams and truth tables. This approach made the learning accessible, memorable, and enjoyable, and it was fantastic to see pupils gaining confidence with a topic that is often seen as difficult.
            <br> <br>
          I also valued the opportunity to experiment with lesson design and resources. Creating worksheets, modelling examples, and trying different approaches helped me find ways to make Computing both accessible and engaging. The feedback I received during observations, both from colleagues in school and through Teach First, was another highlight. It was encouraging to see how much impact small adjustments could have, and to feel my teaching style becoming more natural over time.
            <br> <br>
          One of the most valuable aspects of my first year was the focused observations and feedback I received from colleagues and support roles. Having another set of eyes in the classroom helped me see areas for improvement that I may have missed in the moment. Simple suggestions such as refining how I structured questioning, pacing a particular activity, or making transitions smoother made a huge difference. Over time, these small but consistent adjustments allowed me to refine my teaching and feel more confident in my practice.
            <br> <br>
          Another highlight was the subject-specific support from Teach First. The Computing seminars and training days gave me space to explore ideas with other trainees, learn from experienced practitioners, and bring new strategies back into my own classroom. Having a community of people who understood the unique challenges of teaching Computing made a real difference.
            <br> <br>
          Being part of the wider Teach First network was another source of encouragement. Talking with other trainees, whether in person at training days or online, reminded me that many of us were experiencing similar challenges. Sharing strategies and successes helped me feel less isolated and more part of a wider community of teachers learning together.
            <br> <br>
          This year also gave me the chance to apply my academic background in creative ways. Inspired by training sessions and CPD opportunities, I began experimenting with tools such as <a id="link" href="https://tommysthoughts.thetommyverse.com/canva-create.html">Canva</a>, <a id="link" href="https://tommysthoughts.thetommyverse.com/aila-review.html">Oak National Academy</a>, and <a id="link" href="https://tommysthoughts.thetommyverse.com/gamification-with-ai.html">unplugged activity</a>, simulations, and teaching aids. These experiments allowed me to test out new approaches to learning, blending pedagogy with technology to create resources that were not only engaging but also unique to my classroom. Exploring how these tools could be reimagined for Computing lessons became a real passion, and it pushed me to think more critically about how to make content both accessible and exciting for pupils.
            <br> <br>
          Two moments stand out to me most clearly. The first was parents’ evening, which I had been quite nervous about. To my surprise, it turned out to be one of my favourite experiences of the year, giving me the chance to speak directly with families and share the successes of their children. The second was taking a group of Year 11 pupils to the Institute of Technology for an AI panel. As someone passionate about AI research and experimentation, it was an amazing experience to share that excitement with pupils and see how inspired they were by the discussion.
          </p>
          <h2>Looking Ahead to Year 2</h2>
          <p class="text_computer">
          Although a little late to post this, I wanted to look ahead to my second year of teaching and Teach First. Starting this September, I am stepping into my second year with a sense of excitement and anticipation. One of the things I am most looking forward to is taking on a tutor group. It feels like a new dimension of responsibility, with the opportunity to build strong relationships and support pupils beyond the classroom. Although seeing a significant increase in workload, it will allow me to form connections with pupils in a way that I struggled with when seeing them once a week last year.
            <br> <br>
          I am also excited to be teaching a Year 10 class from the beginning of their GCSE course. Having the chance to set strong foundations over the two years is a challenge I am eager to take on. It has already reinforced the importance of encouraging Year 10 pupils to make clear, effective notes, complete consistent home study tasks that reinforce their classroom learning, and practise handwriting code as they will in their examination. These habits may seem small, but over time they build the confidence and discipline needed to succeed at GCSE.
            <br> <br>
          Equally, I am pleased to be continuing with some of the same classes I taught last year. That sense of continuity means I can build on the progress we have already made together and keep pushing pupils further.
            <br> <br>
          Alongside these responsibilities, I am continuing to engage with the subject-specific Computing support from Teach First. The seminars and resources have already had a big impact on my teaching, and I am looking forward to further developing my subject knowledge and pedagogy in the months ahead.
          </p>
          <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
          <p class="text_computer">
          Balancing teaching, training, and my personal life was one of the toughest parts of Year 1. There were evenings when planning and marking felt endless, and weekends that blurred into schoolwork. Over time, I’ve become more intentional about setting boundaries and using tools like my digital planner to stay organised. It’s still a work in progress, but I know that protecting my own wellbeing is essential if I want to be the best teacher for my pupils.
            <br> <br>
          There was also a moment last year when I realised I had stopped thinking of myself as “just a trainee.” It wasn’t one single event, but rather a combination of things: pupils referring to me as their favourite teacher, receiving thank you cards, positive feedback from observations, and experiences like parents’ evening. By the end of the year, I felt like I had truly stepped into the role of teacher.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="text_computer">
          Looking back on my first year, I can see how much I have grown, both as a teacher and as a person. The challenges of behaviour management, lesson planning, and balancing training with teaching have shaped me in ways I could not have imagined a year ago. At the same time, the highlights and the support I have received have confirmed why I chose this path.
            <br> <br>
          As I begin my second year, I know there will be new challenges ahead, but I feel more equipped to face them with confidence and resilience. Most of all, I am excited to continue learning, to keep improving, and to support my pupils in achieving their best. If my first year was about finding my feet, then my second year is about taking bigger strides.
