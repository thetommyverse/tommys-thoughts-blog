          As the clock strikes midnight and we go into 2026, I find myself looking back on my year defined by exciting developments in my career. 2025 has been an important chapter in my journey as a STEM communicator and educator.
          </p>
          <p>Reflecting on the past twelve months, I am incredibly proud of the milestones that I have achieved.
          </p>
          <h2>Achieving my Qualified Teacher Status & PGCE</h2>
          <p>Securing these qualifications validates the hard work put into my training year and provides me with the skills to support my students and refine my delivery of the Computer Science curriculum.</p>

          <h2>Improving Data Tracking in Computing</h2>
          <p>I had the opportunity these past few months to redesign our department’s systems for data tracking across KS3 and KS4 Computer Science. Between getting data imported quickly and easily and studying this data closely, this has given our department insights into student progress and curriculum impact.</p>

          <h2>Contributing to the Trust's AI Policy</h2>
          <p>It's been exciting to contribute to the Trust's AI Policy, sharing my knowledge on AI and AI tools, giving feedback on guidelines and providing training and support for teachers.</p>

          <h2>Becoming a Canvassador</h2>
          <p>Joining the excellent team of Canva for Education Ambassadors was a personal highlight. It reflects the work that I had been doing with Canva Code to build interface web widgets that transform static resources into playable learning experiences.</p>

          <p>I want 2026 to be about scaling up and reaching out. This year is about deepening my expertise and knowledge, and sharing it more widely with Computer Science, teaching, AI, Edtech and other communities.</p>

          <h2>Completing my MSc-R Thesis</h2>
          <p>After receiving my examiners report, I am focused on completing the revisions for my Masters by Research thesis. My work with LLMs as an academic underpins my practical work with artificial intelligence tools.</p>
          <h2>Expanding AI experimentations</h2>
          <p>The landscape of generative AI and tools is constantly shifting. I plan to dive deeper into existing and new models (tools) to see how much further they can reduce workload, enhance teaching and enhance creativity.</p>

          <h2>Upskilling via CPD</h2>
          <p>I hope to enhance my skills and knowledge further through CPD and training both within AI and beyond it. I am excited to begin exploring the new proposed GCSE Computing qualification and where that leads over the next year.</p>

          <p>I hope to keep posting updates here and on my blog, but more frequently. I hope to go beyond writing and explore more content types, such as video, tutorials and designs.</p>

          <p>Thank you to everyone who has supported, engaged with, and challenged me this year.</p>

          <p>Happy New Year!</p<
